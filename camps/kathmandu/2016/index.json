WordCamps in Nepal were organized under the name of WordCamp Nepal and had been since the formation of WordPress Nepal in 2011. But starting this year, in order to encourage other smaller communities in the country as per an unofficial announcement by WordCamp Central, the concept of WordCamp Kathmandu was born."}
