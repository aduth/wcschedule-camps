This two-day event, held the weekend of September 17-18, and organized by members of the Nashville WordPress MeetUp, will have something for everybody.\n\nAttendees from past years will be familiar with the Saturday programming, with three “tracks” to accommodate users of various skill sets, each track featuring a variety of sessions that are either 50- or 20- minutes long, depending on the topic presented.\n\nDay 2 on Sunday will feature small, hands-on, in-depth classes where users can actively participate on their own computers with an instructor to guide their work. Day 2 will also feature a Core Contribution and Community Organizing workshop, where attendees can learn how to give back to the global and local WordPress Community. Both days will feature a Help Desk\n\nwhere more seasoned WordPress users will be available to help newer users with questions, one on one.\n\nBANNER PHOTO CREDIT: Derrick Brutel"}
